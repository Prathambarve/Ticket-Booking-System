Either the User or Bigtree may terminate this Agreement and a Service with or without cause at any time to be effective immediately.
</p>
<p>
The User agrees that Bigtree may under certain circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate the User's user id 
and access to the Website/Services. Causes for termination may include, but shall not be limited to, breach by the User of this 
Agreement or the TOS, requests by enforcement or government agencies, requests by the User, non-payment of fees owed by the User 
in connection with the Services as specified in the applicable TOS.
</p>
<p>
This Agreement may be terminated by either the User or Bigtree through a written notice to the other. 
Bigtree shall not be liable to the User or any third party for termination of any Service.
 Should the User object to any terms and conditions of this Agreement, any TOS or become dissatisfied with the Service 
 in any way, the User's only recourse is to immediately:<br> 
 (a) discontinue use of the Website/Service; and <br>
 (b) notify Bigtree of such discontinuance.
</p>
<p>
Upon termination of the Service, User's right to use the Website/Services and software shall immediately cease. 
The User shall have no right and Bigtree shall have no obligation thereafter to execute any of the User's uncompleted tasks 
or forward any unread or unsent messages to the User or any third party. Once the User's registration or the Services are terminated, 
cancelled or suspended, any data that the User has stored on the Website may not be retrieved later.
